# Introduction 
The original Keras project of Masked RCNN is: <https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN>. And follow the 'Installation' section in README.md to set up the model. Actually, there is also a good tutorial <https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN#step-by-step-detection> to learn about the object detection.

Currently we have some code that are not ready to check-in.
