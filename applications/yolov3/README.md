# Introduction 
The original keras model was coming from: <https://github.com/qqwweee/keras-yolo3>, clone the project and follow the 'Quick Start' to get the pre-trained model.

We have converted yolov3 model successfully and uploaded to the model zoo. We have some code that are not ready to check-in here.
So please use our pretrained yolov3 onnx model in the model zoo [here](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/yolov3)
